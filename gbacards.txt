GBA Card Games v0.02
by Flavor (http://flavor.8k.com/GBA/ ICQ#17868116) 

Well, here's my first release of my Card Games
for the GameBoy Advance.

I'm using this as a learning tool for myself.  Right now,
it's just BlackJack, but I plan to extend this to other 
card games like video-poker.  Right now, after the opening
screen, you go straight to BlackJack.  Later, there will 
be a menu to choose other games.

This release is known to work with "iGBA beta 8" and
"VGBA v0.5".

I have also tried it with Mappy, but I have noticed some
odd glitches when running it with Mappy.


---------------------------
     Keys/How To Play
---------------------------
A	Hit
B	Stay
UP	Raise Bet (between hands)
DOWN	Lower Bet (between hands)
START	Quit BlackJack (between hands)

The counters show you your current score (money), your 
bet ammount, the CPU's card total, your card total,
and the number of cards in the deck.

When the number of cards in the deck are below 20, 
the deck will be shuffled at the start of the next hand.

- BlackJack
	- You can't split.
	- You can't double down.
