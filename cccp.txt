CCCP [Games/Puzzle]

Made by: Torlus
Released: 2008-02-21

I have released a new game, after more than 2 years of GBA coding inactivity.

CCCP stands for Crystal Clear Clone for Portable (devices). It's a clone of the puzzle Flash game "Crystal Clear": http://www.gamesheep.com/game/crystal-clear/
