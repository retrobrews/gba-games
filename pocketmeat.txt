The gameplay in Pocket Meat is strong and concise.  
You push left or right and your red icon goes.  
Jump, move and generally lose time after time as you attempt the levels.

Pocket Meat by BomberDev is an early attempt to bring Super Meat Boy to the Game Boy Advance --> http://supermeatboy.com/
