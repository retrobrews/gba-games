Version 1.4 May 21 2005
============================

GBA Controls
-------------

The Speccy controls were a bit 'unusual' and I've had to alter them a fair bit 
to make the game playable with the GBA's d-pad and 6 buttons. Below is the list
of controls, together with the 8-bit equivalents.

Press Start after the loading screen to start the game. You begin as Luxor the
Moonprince on the day of the Solstice standing at the Tower of the Moon.
