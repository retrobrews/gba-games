******************************************
The game entry is for the Gameboy Advance.
******************************************


Music:
------
The MOD music in the intro I originally wrote for a little RPG I was working on.


The LCD game:
-------------

You play the Defender, and you must stop the Flying saucer from dropping the big
energy balls on the passing train with your laser sword on every second standing position.
On the other standing positions you get the chance to shoot at the Flying saucer,
and your other task is to shoot it down.

Notes:
------

Every 30 hits to the Flying saucer cause it to crash and you gain 1 extra life.

Every 5 hits to the Flying saucer causes a hamburger and cooldrink to appear at
the extreme right of the display for a brief moment, which can be collected for
bonus points.

If you miss an energy ball with your sword, it's okay as long as it doesn't hit
the train passing beneath.
