Eliminator GBA
by Foxy

Converted from Atari ST by Foxy
The conversion was first done on a PC for SDL model for mobile, our editors have not given away, I threw myself into his adaptation on the GBA.
The graphics come from the Atari version but have been completely reworked by Cyb0rg in 256 colors (graphic designer assigned to the Magic Team).

Description:
At the command of a vessel, a track strewn with obstacles and enemies of all kinds will be your mission ... survive!
It will take serious reflexes, and nerves of steel will be needed to complete the 14 levels of this game.


Eliminator is a shoot’em up set on a patchwork-quilt coloured road, Eliminator puts you in control of a ship with a basic weapon, flying along at breakneck speed.
There are barriers along the way to avoid, often set in quick succession, and lots of bad guys to shoot at or avoid – their shots must be avoided too. Some parts of the track are blocked unless you can shoot through obstacles before reaching them, or hit a jump pad.
At some points you can change to travelling along the ceiling as well. Tokens can be collected en route, and used to obtain better weapons, but losing a life costs you the best one you’ve currently got.
