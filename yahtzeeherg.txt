Link Transfer
********************************************************************************
1-Start the receiving Gameboy without a cartridge inserted and the 2P end of the
  link cable connected.
2-With the 1P end connected to the sending Gameboy, select Send Game Via Link.
3-Once the transfer has finished, you can disconnect the cable.  The game and the
  currently selected background are sent to a second Gameboy Advance and will 
  remain in memory until the power is turned off.

In order to use the "Get highscores" function, both GBAs must be running v0.4+,
and the receiving GBA must be connected to the 1P end of the link cable.  Only
the 1P GBA will get highscores, and if you want to trade both ways, you will
have to reverse the cable and transfer again.

Yahtzee Rules
********************************************************************************
On each turn you may roll up to 3 times, although you may stop after the 1st or 
2nd roll. 

Rolling: 

First roll:  roll all 5 dice.  Set aside any "keepers".  You may stop now and 
score this roll or roll again. 

Second roll:  re-roll any or all dice you want.  Set aside any "keepers".  You 
do not need to declare which combination you're rolling for.  You may stop now 
and score this roll or roll again. 

Third and final roll:  Re-roll any or all dice you want.  After your third roll, 
you MUST fill in a box on the score card with a score or with a zero. 

Scoring: 

When you are finished rolling, decide which box to fill in on the score card.  
There are 13 boxes on the score card.  You MUST fill in a box on each turn.  
If you can't enter a score, you must enter a zero.  Fill in each box only once, 
depending on your best scoring option. 

The score card is divided into an upper section and a lower section.  Scoring 
combinations are as follows: 
  
  Upper Section What to Score 
Aces (Ones) Total of Aces only 
Twos Total of Twos only 
Threes Total of Threes only 
Fours Total of Fours only 
Fives Total of Fives only 
Sixes Total of Sixes only 


Your goal in the upper section is to score a total of at least 63 points to earn 
a 35 point bonus. 
  
  Lower Section What to Score 
3 of a Kind Total of all 5 dice 
4 of a Kind Total of all 5 dice 
Full House 25 points 
Small Straight 30 points 
Large Straight 40 points 
Yahtzee 
(5 of a Kind) 50 points 
Chance Total of all 5 dice 


Full House:  The dice show two of one number and three of another number. 

Small Straight:  The dice show four numbers in sequence, 1 2 3 4, 2 3 4 5, 
or 3 4 5 6. 

Large Straight:  The dice show five numbers in sequence, 1 2 3 4 5, or 2 3 4 5 6. 

Yahtzee:  The dice show five of a kind.  The first Yahtzee you enter in the Yahtzee 
box is worth 50 points.  For each additional Yahtzee you roll, you earn a 100 point 
bonus, and you score the roll in another box according to the Joker Rules. 

If you roll a Yahtzee and have already placed a zero in the Yahtzee box, you do NOT 
earn a Yahtzee bonus.  However, you must fill in one of the 13 boxes using the Joker 
Rules. 

Joker Rules: 

    Score the total of all 5 dice in the appropriate box in the upper section. 

    If the box in the upper section is already filled in, score in the lower section 
as follows: 

        3 of a Kind:  total of all 5 dice 
        4 of a Kind:  total of all 5 dice 
        Full House:  25 points 
        Small Straight:  30 points 
        Large Straight:  40 points 
        Chance:  total of all 5 dice 

Ending the Game: 

Once all 13 category boxes are filled in, the game ends.  Add up the score as follows: 

Upper Section:  add up the scores and enter the total in the Total Score box.  If the 
total is 63 points or more, enter the 35 point bonus in the Bonus box.  Then enter the total in the Total box. 

Lower Section:  add up the scores and enter the total in the Total of Lower Section box.  
Add 100 points for each Yahtzee bonus check mark. 

Grand Total:  add the upper section and lower section totals and enter the total in the 
Grand Total box.  This is the score for the game.
