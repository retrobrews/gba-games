=============================================

Merry Christmas everyone.  After two months in the making, I present to you this full
clone of the original Bust-A-Move (also known as Puzzle Bobble), made by Taito in 1994
for the Neo-Geo arcade system.  I made the game extremely faithful to the original in
every respect.  I have the original 30 arcade levels in single player mode, and I have
also included Link play with two modes of game play.  The classic "Deathmatch" style of
play, and a race mode which uses the single player boards where the first to clear the
screen wins.


Controls
========

Left/Right Arrow Keys  - Aim the pointer
A button               - Fire the ball
Left/Right Triggers    - Fine tune aiming
Start Button           - Pause
Select Button          - Toggle Music or Quit if game is paused


Game Play
========

Single Player Game (Normal and Widescreen):
  The Rules are very simple in single player mode.  Match three or more balls of the same
  color to make them pop.  Any Balls left hanging, after others have popped, will drop off
  the screen and out of play.  Once you clear all of the balls off the screen the level is
  over.  If the balls fall below the bottom line then the game is over, but You get 2 continues
  to try to finish all 30 levels.  And yes, that is Street Fighter 2 Turbo credits music
  playing during the end game credits screen.  I couldn't find a midi of the original
  Bust-A-Move credits music, so I used that instead.  Good music anyways  =P

DeathMatch (Link Play Only):
  The object of deathmatch is to stay alive while trying to "kill" the other player by sending
  them more balls.  Popping any more than 3 balls, as well as dropping balls, will send balls
  to the other player.  The more you pop/drop, the more balls you will send over.  In the center
  is a ball queue which indicates how many balls you will receive after your next shot.  A red
  marker indicates 6 balls, the yellow marker is 1.  The player whose balls drop below the line
  first loses.

Race Mode (Link Play Only):
  Race mode plays all of the original levels but you race against the other player to clear the
  screen first.  The first one to clear the level wins.  If a player's balls drops below the line
  then the other player wins the round, and the next round will start.


Requirements
============

As far as I know this game will run on all the current emulators, but it really shines
on real hardware as it has link play.  Anyone with access to flash writers should give it
a try as it's a blast to play head to head.  It was a lot of fun writing the link code as
this was my first attempt at a linked game.

Note: The game may appear very bright on the emulators.  Sorry about this, I may add a contrast
control to the menu in the future.  I wrote this game specifically for the hardware and, as
you probably know, the screen is incredibly dark, so I had to brighten up the graphics quite
a bit to get it to look good and playable in normal light.
