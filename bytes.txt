BYTES
by eKid
for the PDRoms Coding Competition 2.5
special thanx to all those #gbadev'rs for all their help, www.belogic.com
for their sound tutorials,
www.consolefever.com for sponsoring the compo, and Kojote, for hosting it.

This game is very simple so I don't think I'll have to tell you how to play...
But, if you wanna just play one empty level, hold Left, L, and R, when clicking
"Start Game". (this will also disable highscore functions)

Any questions or feedback can be emailed to mukunda51@hotmail.com, or you 
can catch me on IRC, on EFNet-#gbadev, as eKid.
