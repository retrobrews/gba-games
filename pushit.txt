Game
====
This is a simple puzzle game whereby you must remove
all the available marbles from the game arena.  
To remove marbles, line up at least 3 of the same type.
The marbles can be lined up vertical, horizontally, or
diaganolly.  After removing marbles if you have either  
1 or 2 of that particular type left on the game arena it
is then impossible to complete the level so the game will
restart that level after deducting one live.
Make use of the blocker graphics and the edge of the 
screen to assist in the correct positioning of the marbles.
Marbles will not disappear if any one of the group of 
marbles touches the perimeter of the screen - this makes it 
a little more strategic, otherwise it would be too easy.

If you realise that you have a marble stuck then use the 
select button to quit the level and lose a life.  The
level will restart.

Upon removal of all marbles, your score will be increased 
by the amount of time left - therefore complete the levels
as quick as possible to gain the most points.

When you time gets low a warning will sound and the control
panel will flash indicating time is nearly up.

The game is over when your lives count reaches zero.

Thats it - game has 10 level.
