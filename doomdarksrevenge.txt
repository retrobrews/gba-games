Version 1.1 November 2006
=========================

GBA Controls
-------------
The Speccy controls were  even odder for Doomdark  than the first game.  Rather
than having  all the  locale and  character information  on one  screen, it was
split across several. The focus was taken off the "Think" screen and placed  on
the interaction  with the  other characters  in the  game world.  To this  end,
"Choose"  (E) is  usually the  first screen  that gets  called up  in a  given
situation.

I've  stuck with  the same  basic set  up as  Lords, which  I think  was fairly
playable with  the GBA's  d-pad and  6 buttons.  Below is  the list of controls,
together with their 8-bit equivalents.

Press Start after the loading screen to start the game. You begin as Luxor the
Moonprince standing at the Gate of Varenorn.

Map screen
~~~~~~~~~~~
The map is created as you cross the Icemark. Initially only the Gate of Varenorn
is marked on it, but each new area seen by Luxor and his allies will be 
filled in. The tunnels too are mapped, but they too are only shown once they 
have been explored.

 up, down    - Move the cursor around the map. It starts off at the currently
  left,right    selected character's location.
 A           - Cycle through the characters at a location. Only those loyal to 
                the Moonprince are shown.
 B           - Exit the map screen

Guidance Found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Guidance from  the Wise  can be  found at  any of  the towers  dotted across the
Icemark. The last 5 pieces of guidance given are remembered by the game and  can
be referred back  to as needed.  Be aware though  that any guidance  is accurate
only at  the  time  it is  given, later  on people  will move and objects may be
picked up from their current location.

 A           - Cycle through the guidance received
 B           - Return to the menu

Subtle Differences
-------------------
The evil Mist has no strength draining effect when you are in a tunnel.
Character preferred terrain type, which they move through/across effortlessly, 
is correctly implemented.
