This game wouldn't be possible without:

*  devkit advance by Jason Wilkin available at http://www.io.com/~fenix/devkitadv

*  crt0.s, makefile, linkscript and probably lots of other stuff that I forgot about
   by Jeff Frohwein and others. http://www.devrs.com/

*  gba.h by eloist (heavily modified)

*  tile and map files for Harry Mulders GBTD and GBMB. http://www.devrs.com/gb

*  AFM v1.1 (w) 2001 by Silpheed/Hitmen, Groepaz/Hitmen  www.hitmen-console.org
   this will need to be setup for you to link the code correctly, 
   or you can hack the music stuff out

*  All mods by their respective authors

*  www.visoly.com for running the contest that prompted me to port this from gbc
