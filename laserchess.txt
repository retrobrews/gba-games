=============================================

Many of you will probably not know (or care) what this game is, but here it is anyways, so injoy it, it's
fun.

History
========
LaserChess is a game I originally typed into my Amiga 1000 computer back in the late 80's
from a magazine called 'Compute'.  The game was originally written by Mike Duppong in 1987,
and had apparently won some contest for best original game.  Although not exactly like "real"
Chess, this game has many strategic elements like chess, with the addition of a LASER BEAM!!!  =P.
The one main difference is there are no specific movement rules for the pieces, as they all follow
the same movement rules (one square per move).

So I present LaserChess here in GBA format with the look and feel of the original version.
Although this version has some sounds, they are just goofy sounds that I threw in, as I
don't have any samples of the original LaserChess Sounds.
