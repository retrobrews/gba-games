About the Demo
==============

This is my first real GBA project which is a simple side-scrolling
platform game.  It is built on top of an engine that I am currently
producing.  Basically, as I program this game, I am programming
the engine.


Playing the Game
================

Control-Pad         - Move Wonkie, the main player
Start               - Pause
A                   - Jump
B                   - Toss Head
B+A+Start+Select    - Reset Game
L+R (Title Screen)  - Erase save-game (start from first level again)
?????               - Special debug mode

Be sure to collect your head after you toss it.  You have a limited 
amount to get your head before you die.  The amount of time you have 
remaining is shown in the top-right corner of the screen, named the 
headless meter.

Your health meter is denoted by the 5 hearts next to the headless
meter.  When your health is depleted, you will die and have to start 
at the beginning of the level.

If you happen to throw your head down the pit, you will eventually 
die since you can no longer collect your head.  You might as well 
collect as many gems on the screen while you can.

A portal is at the end of each level.  If you lose your head near 
the end of the level, don't assume that you can make a run for the 
portal.  You must have your head to proceed.

By popular request, the game now saves at the beginning of each level.
So, if you make it to a new level, you may start from that level once 
you turn your GBA back on.  To erase the save, press L and R 
simulataneously at the title screen.


Emulators and GBA Hardware
==========================

This game has been tested and works fully in Visual Boy Advance and 
on real GBA hardware.  For hardware, I used the Flash Advance Linker 
Xtreme USB, 64 Megabit cart.  To obtain a cart (in North America),

Sound System
============

The sound engine used in this game is non-commercial version of 
Krawall Advance (http://mind.riot.org/krawall/).  It allows sounds 
and music to be played.  All music and/or sounds are 
copyright of the respective owners.
