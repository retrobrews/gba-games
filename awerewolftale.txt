A WEREWOLF TALE

If you were looking for something easier to afford, after having broke your teeth with holy hell, this is not the right game to download.
Maybe, if you're a chicken, you can drop down the difficulty level, but it's not so good to be a chicken i guess.
Infact in this Beta 0.1 you can't do it. Let's wait for the final version.
A werewolf tale should be included in the metroidvania genre for some reason, for others it's more close to action puzzle games like N+ and VVVVVV, 
but considering the fact that you'll see more gameovers than high scores, i think it reminds a lot the total-chaos-destruction feeling of bangai-o.
2nd PLACE at NEOFLASH 2012 Summer competition
Enjoy!
