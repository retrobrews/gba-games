Negative Space is a homebrew puzzle/platform game for the NDS, based on the concept of negative space.
The whole game contains only two colors: black and white. The player controls two ‘blob’ characters: 
the white blob moves in the black space, and the black blob in the white space. 
That’s why, empty space for one blob represents solid ground and walls for the other.

The aim of the game is for each blob to capture its corresponding flag. 
In order to do so, the player can draw directly on the touch screen in black or white and thus modify 
the levels and create new paths and platforms. But keep in mind that a new path for one blob means 
new walls for the other!
