=============================================

This is part two of an old Asteroids Demo I made about 7 months ago.  Some of the changes I
made are as follows:

  - Shields system
  - Scrolling Backgrounds
  - Flying saucer enemies
  - Authentic "Asteroids" sounds

The principal is essentially the same.  A bunch of asteroids are floating around...  Shoot them.
With the occasional flying saucer coming around to kill you.  I changed the movement system so that
the ship is always in center screen.  When you thrust, everything around you moves instead.  The
background scrolls in the direction of your movement to help you see how fast your moving.  I think
way is actually better than the old way of flying around the screen.  With the screensize limitation
of the GBA this way just seems to feel better.

I've also added a shields system to the game.  There is a counter in the bottom left corner of the
screen to show how much shields you have left.  The shields regenerate by destroying asteroids and
flying saucers up to a max of 50.  Use the shields by either pressing Down on the d-pad or the upper
right trigger button.
