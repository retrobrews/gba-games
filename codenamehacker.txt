Story : 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Codename Hacker is a puzzle game, originally from the Atari Lynx.

Chip would do anything for Melinda the Mental Marvel. More than anything because 
he wanted to join Melinda's exclusive computer club - the Bit Busters. So you can 
imagine how Chip felt when Melinda sat down next to him in the school cafeteria 
and offered him membership... on one condition.

Take control of Chip as he does some heavy interfacing with a few interesting 
puzzles. Melinda will monitor your progress as you enter and work your way 
through 149 levels of challenging maze-like paths and puzzles. Once you accept 
the challenge, there's no escape. Monsters, traps and the ticking of the clock
all conspire to delete you before a level is completed.

You must ram blocks of soil together to create bridges over water traps, or use 
them as buffers against cherry bombs. Invisible partitions will impede your 
progress. Coloured keys will open doors that kead to other keys that will open 
still more doors!
To make it through, you must keep puzzle sequences stored in your memory.

Most levels have a specific number of chips that you must collect before you can 
progress to the next level. Sometimes you must snatch those chips from under the 
very noses of deadly bugs who are just aching to take a byte out of you!

Well Chip, are you still up for the challenge? You can't get that Bit-Busters 
T-shirt out of your system, can you? OK buddy, make tracks for level one of 
Chip's Challenge!

Instructions:  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You have to collect a set amount of chips on every level,not necessarily all of 
them. In your path are several puzzle parts :

TRAPS must be disarmed before you can pass through them. There are various sorts 
of traps. For example, some hold you prisoner until your time runs out, while 
others destroy  you as soon as you step on them. You can disarm traps with 
strategic placement of dirt blocks.

FORCE FLOOR TRAPS [Conveyor belts] propel you with lightning speed from one area 
to another without allowing you to stop. Sometimes you can use this force to 
propel you to a desired location, however most of the time you will need to 
collect a magnet to neutralise the effect.

FIRE TRAPS are impassible bonfires laid out to block your progress. Use a fire 
shield to walk through fire traps.

WATER TRAPS can be crossed in two ways. Either build a bridge of dirt blocks or 
have a water shield in your inventory.

ICE TRAPS are slippery obstacles that make you slide right past your goal. Cleats 
are required to be able to walk over ice traps.

MONSTERS want to destroy you and will show no mercy. One touch from a monster and 
you'll cash in your chips.

TANKS block the way through crucial paths in some levels. Tanks are always linked 
to trip buttons, so the way around them is to activate the correct trip button so 
they move out of your way.

THIEVES. Touching a thief wipes your inventory of all items. Make sure you use the 
tools you need to collect microchips before trying to pass a thief.

TELEPORT SQUARES move you to another location in the level. Some squares teleport 
you in the direction you were facing when you stepped on them. Others teleport you 
in random directions. Beware! if you step on the only teleport square that is
accessible, you will be trapped.

TOGGLE BLOCKS are outlined with broken coloured lines. These blocks can be solid 
or transparent. When the toggle block is solid, you cannot pass through. These 
blocks are linked to trip buttons. When you activate a trip button, the toggle 
blocks linked to it will switch to the other stated (Solid or transparent).

MICROCHIP SOCKETS are special objects found on most levels. You must pass through 
a microchip socket to reach the Exit Square, but only after you have collected the 
required number of microchips for that level.

CLONE MACHINES discharge fireballs, dirt blocks and other items. Most clone 
machines are linked to trip buttons. If you wish to start/stp a clone machine, 
activate the linked trip button.

BLUE BLOCKS can be real walls or just an illusion. To figure out which a particular 
block is, try to pass through it. If it is an illusion, it will disappear.

Helpfull items :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEYS open doors. Pick them up to add them to your inventory. To use a key, walk 
up to a door of the same colour as the key. Most keys will disappear from your 
inventory.

DOORS are opened by keys of the same colour. Once the coloured door is open it 
stays open.

MICROCHIPS enable you to pass each level's microchip socket. Most levels have a 
required number of microchips you must collect before you can pass through the 
microchip socket to the Exit Square.

EXIT SQUARES are flashing squares found on every level. Step on an exit square to 
proceed to the next level. Exit squares are usually blocked by microchip sockets.

DIRT BLOCKS can be linked together to form bridges over water, pushed against a 
bomb to explode it harmlessly, or used as blocks against monsters, deadly lightning 
balls, and other moving obstacles.  You can only move one brown dirt block at a 
time. If you place a dirt block to make a bridge over water, you must stamp down 
the dirt to turn it into a regular floor square. To do this, step on the block 
after pushing it into the water.

NOTE: You may find things hidden under some dirt blocks. Sometimes the things you 
find are valuable, like microchips. However you may find that a block is covering 
something unpleasant, such as a fire trap.

TRIP BUTTONS are linked to toggle blocks, clone machines, and other obstacles. A 
trip button's colout matches the colour of the linked trap or obstacle. For example, 
moving over a green trip button square will open (or close) all linked green toggle 
blocks or moving over a red trip button square will cause a red linked clone 
machine to begin releasing fireballs!

MAGNETS neutralize [sic] the effect of force floor traps. With a magnet in the 
inventory, you can walk over a force floor normally.

FIRE SHIELDS neutralize fire. With a fire shield in the inventory, you can walk 
through fire [But not fireballs].

WATER SHIELDS allow you to walk on water.

CLEATS allow you to travel over ice traps without slipping.

NOTE: Magnets, fire shields, water shields and cleats stay in inventory. They do 
not disappear after they are used.
