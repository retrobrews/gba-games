     <name>3 WEEKS IN PARADISE</name>
     <desc>Based on a classic ZX Spectrum game from the 80&apos;s. This is a puzzle game. It requires some strange thinking to complete some of the puzzles. The idea is to utilise the scattered objects in certain ways with other objects and/or with scenery. As you complete parts of the puzzle, other items may appear or you may complete partof the puzzle. You need to complete 100% of the puzzles to free your wife (wilma) and son (herbert)and escape the island.</desc>

     <name>BATTLE PICROSS</name>
     <desc>Picross is a puzzle game where you try to reveal a picture. The puzzle lies in the process of revealing the picture. To reveal the picture, you are given hints as to blocks of continuous pixels. Each block of pixels is listed by row and by column. You are to use these numbers to help you reveal the picture. The number hints are like clues in a crossword puzzle - hence the name Picross! Now, this game is different than similar types of picross games. There is a lower time limit in this game. However, you are allowed to use items that you collect to help reveal the puzzle. It is a more franctic game that causes you to think just a little faster than with other puzzle games. And so we have Battle Picross! CONTROLS: You mainly control the chizzel tool on the puzzle surface. You use the chizzel to to reveal the puzzle. To chizzel a part of the puzzle, position the tool accordingly, and then press the A button. If you know that a certain tile is not part of the puzzle, it is wise to mark it with an "X" so that you don&apos;t forget this fact. To do this, press the B button. Marking "X"s on the puzzle is not required to win the puzzle. It is only there to help you remember which tiles are not part of the picture. You can use items to help you reveal the picture. To do this, slide in your items window with the R button. While holding the R button, select the desired item with the cursor keys and press the A button. If you do not wish to use an item, just let go of the R button instead. You have to obtain items by completing puzzles.</desc>

     <desc>Press START to begin a game of Collision Course. Rotate your white triangular ship counterclockwise by pressing the left side of the control pad, and right to rotate it clockwise. Apply forward thrust to your ship by pressing the top side of the control pad. Your ship decelerates when thrust is not applied. Press the A button to fire your weapon at the green rocks floating around your ship. Holding down the button causes your weapon to fire repeatedly. Each large rock, when hit by your weapon, fragments into two medium-sized rocks (20 points each), and each medium-sized rock into two small rocks (50 points each). Small rocks disintegrate completely (100 points each). After all the rocks are destroyed, more will appear after a few seconds in the areas indicated by the red arrows. Maneuver your ship out of the hazardous areas before they appear. At random times, a violet UFO will appear and begin shooting at rocks and your ship. Destroying it is worth 500 points. If your ship crashes or is destroyed by the UFO's weapon, you have two reserve ships ready to replace it. For each 10,000 points you earn you will be rewarded with a new reserve ship. If your ship is destroyed, and you have no remaining ships, the game is over.</desc>

     <desc>The purpose of the game is to control the movement of robots on a factory floor, and get them to take raw material from a Dispenser, put them in a Processor, then take the processed material and drop it into a Collector. This is accomplished by placing instructions on the factory floor grid, and when a robot passes over the instruction, it obeys it. Instructions including turning four different directions, and performing an action. The action that is performed is dependent on what is nearby, this will either be picking up a nearby object, dropping a carried object, or nothing; if nothing applies. It&apos;s also possible to introduce additional robots to a stage.</desc>

The player controls two 'blob' characters: the white blob moves in the black space, and the black blob in the white space. That's why, empty space for one blob represents solid ground and walls for the other. The aim of the game is for each blob to capture its corresponding flag. In order to do so, the player can draw directly on the touch screen in black or white and thus modify the levels and create new paths and platforms. But keep in mind that a new path for one blob means new walls for the other!</desc>

The only thing Pac is able to do to prolong his life is find the bottles of Pac Beer floating around in space. Each time a ghost hits pac, he loses 1 pac-health. Drinking a bottle of Pac-beer will restore 1 pac-health. In the event you need to make a quick escape there is also a warp bucket at the bottom middle of the screen that will use advanced pac teleport technology to warp you to one of the 4 corners of the screen. Use at your own risk.</desc>

     <name>PUSH-IT</name>
     <desc>This is a simple puzzle game whereby you must remove all the available marbles from the game arena. To remove marbles, line up at least 3 of the same type. The marbles can be lined up vertical, horizontally, or diaganolly. After removing marbles if you have either 1 or 2 of that particular type left on the game arena it is then impossible to complete the level so the game will restart that level after deducting one live.</desc>

     <desc>Use the D-Pad to steer your jet to avoid the flashy bullet thingies. Press B to fire at enemies. Collect Powerups (the "P" things that fly around) to strengthen your firepower. Press A to launch a big missile that blows up lots of stuff. It also makes you invulnerable for a short period. You will start with 2 of these with each life. The "B" pickups will supply you with an extra missile. If you touch a bullet then you will explode and lose a life! If you have no more extra lives, (shown in top-left/right corner) the game will end. You may continue from the beginning of the level (but you lose your score).</desc>
