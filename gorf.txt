All right folks, it’s been fun, but this is officially the final, final release candidate for GORF.
Fish gotta fly, birds gotta swim, and I’ve got to move on to new projects.  
Namely, sitting around eating Funyuns in my underwear while watching old cartoons on DVD and doing barely any homework.
There’s only one major change to this release… faster quark shots for the player.  Some guy named Goochman made the recommendation, lamenting that the Flagship was too hard to beat.
I must reluctantly concede that yes, the quark laser was much faster in the arcade game and that it should have been that way from the start in this release.  
I was worried about how this change would affect the gameplay, but judging from my playtesting it seems to be an improvement.
The game feels a bit peppier than past releases, although if you’ve gotten used to the timing in the earlier versions, you’ll have to retrain yourself.
Also, while taking a break from beating up Gary Coleman, Goochman informed me that the collision detection for the flagship’s nuclear core was much too unforgiving.
I grudgingly added four more pixels of vulnerability, but that’s as much ground as I’m willing to give to those individuals who asked for an easy version of the game.
Sorry, but GORF isn’t meant to be easy.  It’s a manly game for manly men, designed by a manly man who became a manly woman.
The point I’m trying to make is that GORF gives ‘till it hurts, but demands just as much from the player.
Besides, with the faster quark lasers, making this easier would be as sporting as shooting skeet with guided missiles.
There will be no teddy bear modes and no hand-holding… and in this era of frantic bullet hell shooters, there shouldn’t be.
So that’s it.  The last dance, the final countdown, the whipped cream and cherry on the sundae.
I may include box artwork and an instruction booklet at a later date, but unless there’s a cataclysmic bug somewhere in the code that I missed, there will be no more work done on GORF.
